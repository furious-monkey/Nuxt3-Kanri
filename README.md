# Kanri

Successor to Kanban Electron, rewritten using Tauri and Nuxt.js v3 with TypeScript.
**Very early prototype, currently porting over all old features from Kanban Electron.**

It is not advised to use this app for anything right now, as it is lacking important features and might have critical bugs. For the time being, you can use Kanban Electron.
