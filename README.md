A fully offline cross-platform Kanban Board desktop, with a focus on simplicity and user experience. Successor to Kanban Electron, rewritten using Tauri and Nuxt.js v3 with TypeScript.

> **Warning**: This is a very early version, it is advised to make regular JSON exports and not save any important data in this software yet.

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap (planned features)

- [ ] Custom backgrounds in board view
- [X] New logo and minor redesign

Open for any contributions or feature requests, though always keep in mind that I am still a student with limited time and I might not be able to process every request immediately.
