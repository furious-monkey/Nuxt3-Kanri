A fully offline cross-platform Kanban Board desktop, with a focus on simplicity and user experience. Successor to Kanban Electron, rewritten using Tauri and Nuxt.js v3 with TypeScript.

> **Note**: This is a fairly early and untested version, it is advised to make regular JSON exports and not save any business-critical data in this software yet. Any testers that provide feedback are greatly appreciated.

**Features**:
- Familiar Kanban board layout with clean design
- Fully offline with local data saves in a JSON file
- Theming system with 3 presets and custom theming ability (color scheme & custom background images)
- Keyboard shortcuts for easy Kanban board navigation
- Start page with board preview tiles
- Full data exports as a JSON file
