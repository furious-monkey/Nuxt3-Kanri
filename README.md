Kanri is a Kanban board desktop app for Mac, Windows and Linux with a familiar layout (inspired by Trello) with a focus on simplicity and user experience. All of your data is saved locally and can be fully exported at any time, so there are no privacy concerns. Furthermore, the app is customizable with themes and custom backgrounds, you can see an example of a customized app below:

You can download it for free [from the GitHub releases!](https://github.com/trobonox/kanri/releases)

## âœ¨ Features:

> **Note**: This is a fairly early and untested version, it is advised to make regular JSON exports. Any testers that provide feedback are greatly appreciated.


## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap (planned features)
The long term vision for this app is to keep improving current features, expand it with useful new tools (which can be suggested by users) and in the end also add cloud sync capabilities which would also allow collaboration at a later stage. To address privacy concerns, the backend will have self hosting instructions alongside the identical version hosted by me.
Keep in mind that the cloud features are only set for the far future, a granular list of current priorities can be found [in the roadmap in the projects tab of this GitHub repo](https://github.com/trobonox/kanri/projects).

This project for any contributions or feature requests, though always keep in mind that I am still a student with limited time and I might not be able to process every request immediately.
