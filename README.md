## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap (planned features)

- [ ] UI improvements like a bar for quick actions in the board view

- [ ] Add tests to prevent any critical bugs
- [ ] Add custom scrollbars for all pages

Open for any contributions or feature requests, though always keep in mind that I am still a student with limited time and I might not be able to process every request immediately.
